## Content Rules

### Contest Names

**Rule**: All contest names **must** be in Title Case.

- **Lowercase articles and prepositions**: "of", "at", "for", "in", "to", "the", "and", "or", "a" (unless at the start of the name)
- **Keep acronyms capitalized**: BOE, PSC, PUD, EMC, etc.
- **Parenthetical suffixes**: Preserve as written, typically in parentheses (e.g., "State Court Judge (Hanson)")

**Examples**:
- ❌ `BOARD OF EDUCATION AT LARGE-POST 7` → ✅ `Board of Education At Large-Post 7`
- ❌ `CIVIL/MAGISTRATE COURT JUDGE` → ✅ `Civil/Magistrate Court Judge`
- ❌ `STATE COURT JUDGE (HANSON)` → ✅ `State Court Judge (Hanson)`
- ❌ `MACON WATER AUTHORITY-AT LARGE` → ✅ `Macon Water Authority-At Large`

### Website URLs

**Rule**: Website display text `[text]` stays lowercase; only the URL in parentheses must be lowercased.

**Format**:
```markdown
[lowercase-display.org](https://lowercase-url.org)
```

**Examples**:
- ❌ `[mortonforschools.org](https://MORTONFORSCHOOLS.ORG)` → ✅ `[mortonforschools.org](https://mortonforschools.org)`
- ❌ `[votehatcher.com](https://VOTEHATCHER.COM)` → ✅ `[votehatcher.com](https://votehatcher.com)`

### Occupations

**Rule**: Occupation fields must use proper case. Common acronyms must be uppercase.

**Common abbreviations to normalize**:
- `Ceo` → `CEO`
- `Cfo` → `CFO`
- `Cpa` → `CPA`
- `Clio` → `CLO` (Chief Legal Officer)
- `Llc` → `LLC`
- `Llp` → `LLP`
- `Ret` → `Retired` (expand if part of longer phrase like "Ret Educator" → "Retired Educator")

**Judgment**: Only normalize clear acronyms. Do not alter general occupations like "Educator", "Attorney", "Business Owner", etc.

**Examples**:
- ❌ `Ceo` → ✅ `CEO`
- ❌ `Cpa` → ✅ `CPA`
- ❌ `Blue Armor Network of America Llc` → ✅ `Blue Armor Network of America LLC`
- ✅ `Software Engineer` (no change)
- ✅ `Retired Educator` (no change)

## Tables

### Candidate Table Columns

1. **Candidate** — Full name (no normalization)
2. **Status** — `Qualified` or `Withdrawn` (must use these exact values)
3. **Incumbent** — `Yes` or `No`
4. **Occupation** — Title Case, proper acronyms capitalized
5. **Qualified** — Date in MM/DD/YYYY format
6. **Email** — Email address or `—` (em-dash) if not provided
7. **Website** — Markdown link `[display](https://url)` or `—` if not provided

## Metadata

- **Contests** — Numeric count of distinct contests (contest headings)
- **Candidates** — Numeric count of all candidate rows across all contests

Count accurately; these are used for filtering and navigation.
